### Factory Pattern
We would like to use an Abstract Factory to create products for inventory and at the same time set the price of the product. The price of the product is set after the product is created and is read from a database (in this assignment that database can be file of product names and prices.). For setting the price of the product one can use a Factory Method pattern.
